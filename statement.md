**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**
When an institution manages its data of students (here, marks), it can lead the following issues:
•	Redundancy and errors in entered data
•	Difficulty in correcting/updating data
•	Difficulty in retrieving data
These errors may occur due to the situation a person is while doing the certain work, or generally since as humans, we can’t avoid errors.
Introducing a computer-based system can help reduce these errors and also increase the efficiency of doing this work manually by a person.
**SCOPE OF PROJECT:**
Collecting student details such as roll number, name, and marks for five predefined subjects
Storing all records permanently in a CSV file
Allowing users to view, update, and delete data through a menu-driven interface

School administrations
Programming Beginners and learners 
**HIGH-LEVEL FEATURES:**
Student Record Storage
