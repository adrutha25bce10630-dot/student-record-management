**PROBLEM STATEMENT**
When an institution manually manages student data (such as marks), several challenges commonly arise:
* Data redundancy and human-entry errors
* Difficulty in correcting or updating existing records
* Inconvenience in retrieving data when needed
These issues often occur due to human limitations, workload, or inconsistencies in data handling.
To overcome these drawbacks, introducing a computer-based system can significantly improve accuracy, reduce errors, and enhance the overall efficiency of managing student records.

**SCOPE OF THE PROJECT**
This project focuses on developing a simple Python-based student record management system that:
* Collects essential student details including roll number, name, and marks for five predefined subjects
* Stores all records permanently in a CSV file to ensure long-term data availability
* Provides a user-friendly, menu-driven interface
* Allows users to easily add, view, update, and delete student records
* Demonstrates practical implementation of:
    * Python functions
    * File handling
    * Loops
    * Modular programming concepts
* Serves as an example of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in Python

**TARGET USERS**
* Teachers and subject instructors
* School administrative departments
* Students and beginners learning programming concepts
  
**HIGH-LEVEL FEATURES**
  * **Permanent Student Record Storage**
    Data is saved in a CSV file for future reference.
  * **Menu-Driven Interface**
    Users can interact with the system easily through on-screen options.
  * **Complete CRUD Functionality**
    Users can create, read, update, and delete student records as required.
  * **Modular Program Design**
    Code is structured into functions for better reusability and clarity.
  * **Lightweight and Portable**
    No database installation required; works on any machine with Python.
