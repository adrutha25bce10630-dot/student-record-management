# **Student Marks Management System**
## **Overview**
The **Student Marks Management System** is a Python-based console application that allows users to manage academic records of students using a CSV file for storage.  
The system offers a simple, menu-driven interface that enables users to perform full CRUD operations:
* **Create** – Add new student record  
* **Read** – View the stored data  
* **Update** – Modify existing student information  
* **Delete** – Remove records from the system  
This project demonstrates practical usage of Python functions, file handling, loops, and modular programming techniques.

## **Features**
1. Menu-driven console interface  
2. Developed entirely in Python using built-in modules  
3. Handles missing files and invalid user inputs  
4. Clean, modular code that is easy to understand and extend  
5. Fully supports CRUD operations  
6. Stores data permanently in a CSV file

## **Technologies / Tools Used**
**Python 3.13** – Programming language used  
**CSV (Comma-Separated Values)** – Format for storing records  
**csv module** – For reading and writing data  
**os module** – For validating and deleting files  
**Command Line / Terminal** – User interface for running the program  
**Text Editor or IDE (e.g., IDLE)** – Used to write and modify the program
